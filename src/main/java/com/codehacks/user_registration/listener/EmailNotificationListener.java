/**
 * EmailNotificationListener - Event Listener for sending welcome emails
 *
 * This class demonstrates:
 * 1. Event-driven architecture with Spring's @EventListener
 * 2. Decoupling of business logic from side effects
 * 3. Integration with real email service
 * 4. Event listener ordering and priority
 *
 * Event Listener Concepts:
 * - @EventListener methods are automatically invoked when matching events are published
 * - Multiple listeners can respond to the same event independently
 * - Listeners are decoupled from the event publisher and from each other
 * - Events are processed synchronously by default (same thread as publisher)
 *
 * Benefits of Event-Driven Email Notifications:
 * - User registration logic doesn't need to know about email sending
 * - Easy to add/remove notification features without changing core logic
 * - Can easily switch between different notification providers
 * - Supports multiple notification types (email, SMS, push notifications)

    /**
     * Handle UserRegisteredEvent by sending a welcome email
     *
     * @EventListener Annotation Details:
     * - Automatically invoked when UserRegisteredEvent is published
     * - Method parameter type determines which events this listener handles
     * - Spring uses reflection to find and invoke listener methods
     * - Listeners are invoked in the same transaction as the event publisher
     *
     * @Order Annotation:
     * - Controls the execution order when multiple listeners exist
     * - Lower values have higher priority (execute first)
     * - Useful when listeners have dependencies on each other
     *
     * @param event the UserRegisteredEvent containing user details
